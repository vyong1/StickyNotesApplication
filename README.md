# StickyNotesApplication



## Synopsis

A C# WPF application for managing homework sticky notes and todo's across different computers

## Intended Design

Overall *Intended* design (final product):
The application runs on startup, reading a file that can be shared across computers in some way (the cloud or something). For now, this file is just a specially formatted .txt, but the future plan is to implement a custom user-interface that modifies a custom formatted file. Additionally, I would like the user to be able to sort assignments by due date, class, priority, or other things (still up in the air, but sorting by due date is a big priority).

## Motivation

The default windows sticky notes application didn't have functionality for sharing sticky notes across computers. I did like how fast and convenient it was for writing down homework assignments, so

## Tests

All tests are in StickyNotesApplication_Tests and are run using the NUnit testing framework, which can be obtained from NuGet. (Note that you also have to download the NUnit Test Runner to run the tests)
